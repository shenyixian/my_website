#### About Me
Hi, my name is Liam Cheung! I grew up in Singapore and then I moved to Sydney, Australia.  
I settled in Melbourne, a city known for its coffee and cultural references.  
Before LBS, I studied Accounting and Finance at **Melbourne University**. I am a professional Viola
player, and I was lucky enough to have survived the Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand back in
2011.  
I was an apprentice at **Adelaide Symphony Orchestra**, where I was promoted to guest Violinist
afterwards.  
I co-founded the Go Society at University of Sydney and I have tutored many students to not only
learn, but also enjoy playing Viola.  

#### Professional Experience
I have interned at an asset management company where I covered SaaS and dairy companies. I then
interned at PE and IB advisory firms covering Real Estate, Media and Industrials related transactions.  

#### Why Am I Here:
Whilst I found traditional tools such as Excel to be handy, I did realise that I needed something that
is designed to handle a huge amount of data efficiently. Given the competitive nature of the
industry, R and other data analytics platforms are vital for me to gain an extra edge in my future
career in making sound investments.  
I aim to commit myself to a career in finance and I believe R and other programming languages are
exceptionally powerful to analyse data. They are platforms which many professionals are using in
the industry and they are essential in tomorrowâ€™s workplace to be a successful investor.

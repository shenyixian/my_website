<p>At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">Wikipedia GDP page</a>.</p>
<p>The GDP data we will look at is from the <a href="https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads">United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database</a>, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country’s GDP. The file we will work with is <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6">GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars</a> and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by <code>1e9</code>, or <span class="math inline">\(10^9\)</span>), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.</p>

<p>Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption <em>C</em>), Gross Capital Formation (business investment <em>I</em>), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator <code>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</code> in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>For these three countries, household consumption is the largest element of expenditure across the economy, and we think it is also an important indicator of a country’s economy landscape. As a country develops, the proportion of household expenditure, which is the expense of people’s daily basic need, will go down, and other proportion will increase. This is pretty much like the Engel’s law. For India, the proportion of household expenditure is the highest among three, which shows it is still a developing country. However, with the fast speed it developed during the late 20th century, this proportion went down and capital formation increased. A negative net exports shows that it imports a greater value than it exports, it has a trade deficit. For developed countries Germany and US, their graphs are somehow alike. However, Germany’s net exports increased a lot since 21th century, which means Germany’s goods are so competitive. We believe it is because reputation for quality precision engineering gives them a competitive advantage in selling goods to foreign countries, as well as the relatively weak euro.</strong></p>
